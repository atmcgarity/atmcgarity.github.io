    <h1 class="description">Hello everyone, my name is Alex, I'm 24 years old, and I am currenty learning to code through MIT's xPro Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. I decided to enter this program in order to find a long lasting job in a field where there is a lot of oppertunity. In this page you can find a few of the projects I have been working on so far. They are far from perfect but as by abilities develop over time I hope I can improve upon them and develop more projects in the future. Check out my GitHub or LinkedIn profiles above if you want to see more. If you want to contact me the best way to do so is through my email: atmcgarity2@gmail.com. Thanks for visiting my page!</h2>
